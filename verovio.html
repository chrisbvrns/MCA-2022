        <p>When comparing both the MEI file and MusicXML file, I can see the differences - some being minute, and some being a little larger. I do however prefer some of the MEI attributes, particularly the way it is layered and structured as it's more readable to the human eye. However, the MusicXML file provides the information about the music piece in a simpler way. For example, for the Clef, the XML file will tell you the "sign" and the "line" - whereas the MEI file gives each part an id which in order for the machine to read it. The same goes for each of the Notes and the Time Signature too. I beleive using both formats are useful at providing information about the music piece. I also believe that with the MusicXML file being so simpel to read, it makes reading (and writing/editing) an MEI file far easier. Particularly when MEI is so enriched with metadata for machines to understand.  </p></div>
