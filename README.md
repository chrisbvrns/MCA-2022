## Week 1 - Write Up 

### Task 1 - Identify a Theme

The theme I have chosen for my Music Curation and Analysis project is based on American electronic dance artist Porter Robinson. I've chosen Porter as my theme as I'm personally a massive fan of Porter's music and his journey through dance music (as well as how he's altered my own taste in music over the years). Porter is an artist I'm familiar with as I am regular listener of his music through the likes of his own alias and his side project Virtual Self. Porter has released 3 studio albums "Spitfire" "Worlds" and "Nurture" as well as a variety of E.P's and Singles. For the MuseScore task, I will be using a piano rendition of his breakthrough single "Language".

### Types of Data

#### Musical Scores (Notated Data)

I managed to find several fan curtated sheet music through the likes of [musicnotes.com](https://www.musicnotes.com/sheet-music/artist/porter-robinson) and the [MuseScore](https://musescore.com/user/37423453/scores/6737762) website. What I found is that most of the sheet music is something you'd have to pay for. For my selected piece ["Language"](https://www.scribd.com/document/134073550/Porter-Robinson-Language), I used scribd.com, which allowed for a 1 month free trial to download sheet music. 

#### Metadata (Descritpive Data) 

[Porter Robinson's own website](https://porterrobinson.com/) is one of the best places to start looking for descriptive data of his music catalogue. Not only is it the best, it is unique as it uses a VR function to navigate a world where his music appears. There are tabs to explore some of his data. Within the "Music" tab, you can can find his latest album which shows all availble platforms that you can listen to it on such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, YouTube and SoundCloud. On these platforms, users can find descriptive data such as Artists, Track Names, Album Names, Album and Single Artwords, Genre, Track Length, Composer, Producer Credits and Copyright Information. To add, on Spotify (which is the platform I use), there are various recommendations for listeners of Porter Robinson - curated by algorithms, users listening habits as well as artist recommended playlists. For example, there is a "This is Porter Robinson" playlist which is a collection of his biggest songs (likely based on most listened to by all users). There is a "Porter Robinson Radio" playlist which includes Spotify's recommended tracks, likely based on user listening habits with other artists similar to Porter. There is also a "Fans Also Like" section for users to find simialr artists to Porter Robinson. 

#### Audio Recordings (Acoustic Data) 

Porter's catalogue of music can be found on major streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music as well as YouTube. Furthermore, Porter Robinson has physical releases of his music on formats such as CD's and LP's. On top of this, Porter performs his own live shows where he plays his music, such as his own music festival - [Second Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMc-4GsuXJc&t=3844s). Finally, you can also find fan covers, remixes and lyric videos on the likes of YouTube and SoundCloud.

### Challenges Faced 

One of the challenges I found was finding notated data directly from produced from the artist himself. As mentioned above, I could only really find sheet music from cover artists. Another challenge with working with curated data (particularly in my case) is copyright. As some of Porter's catalogue is licensed under Sony, there may be copyright issues in relation to using his music. This is something I acknowledge for this project as it is beign used for being educational purposes only - however if it were to be used outside of education (i.e. distributing to the public), I understand that there would be copyright implications I would have to bypass in order for this to be possible.
