		<h2>Task 1 - Identify a Theme</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>The theme I have chosen for my Music Curation and Analysis project
		is based on American electronic dance artist Porter Robinson.
		I've chosen Porter as my theme as I'm personally a massive fan of Porter's music and
		his journey through dance music (as well as how he's altered my own taste in music over the years).<br>
		<br>

		<br>
		Porter is an artist I'm familiar with as I am regular listener of his music through
		the likes of his own alias and his side project Virtual Self.
		Porter has released 3 studio albums "Spitfire" "Worlds" and "Nurture" as well as a variety of E.P's and Singles. 
		For the MuseScore task, I will be using a piano rendition of his breakthrough single "Language".</p>

		<h2>Types of Data</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Musical Scores - Notated Data</h3>
		<br>
		<p>I managed to find several fan curtated sheet music through the likes of <a href="https://www.musicnotes.com/sheet-music/artist/porter-robinson">Musicnotes</a> and the <a href="https://musescore.com/user/37423453/scores/6737762">MuseScore</a> website.
		What I found is that most of the sheet music is something you'd have to pay for.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Metadata - Descriptive Data</h3>
		<br>
		<p><a href="https://porterrobinson.com/">Porter Robinson's</a> own website is one of the best places to start looking
		for descriptive data of his music catalogue. Not only is it the best, it is unique
		as it uses a VR function to navigate a world where his music appears, immersing the user into a virtual museum. There are tabs
		to explore some of his data. Within the "Music" tab, you can can find his latest album which 
		shows all availble platforms that you can listen to it on such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music,
		YouTube and SoundCloud. On these platforms, users can find descriptive data such as Artists,
		Track Names, Album Names, Album and Single Artwords, Genre, Track Length, Composer, Producer Credits and
		Copyright Information.</p><br>

		<br>
		<br>
		<p>To add, on Spotify (which is the platform I use), there are various recommendations for 
		listeners of Porter Robinson - curated by algorithms, users listening habits as well as artist recommended playlists. 
		For example, there is a "This is Porter Robinson" playlist which is a collection of his biggest songs (likely based on most listened to by all users).
		There is a "Porter Robinson Radio" playlist which includes Spotify's recommended tracks, likely based on user listening habits with other artists similar to Porter.
		There is also a "Fans Also Like" section for users to find similar artists to Porter Robinson.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Audio Representation - Acoustic Data</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Porter's catalogue of music can be found on major streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music
		as well as YouTube. Furthermore, Porter Robinson has physical releases of his music on formats
		such as CD's and LP's. On top of this, Porter performs his own live shows where he plays his music,
		such as his own music festival - Second Sky (video below). Finally, you can also find fan covers, remixes and lyric videos
		on the likes of YouTube and SoundCloud.</p><br>

		<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
		<br>
		<p>One of the challenges I found was finding notated data directly from produced from the artist himself.
		As mentioned above, I could only really find sheet music from cover artists. Another challenge with working with 
		curated data (particularly in my case) is copyright. As some of Porter's catalogue is licensed under Sony, 
		there may be copyright issues in relation to using his music. This is something I acknowledge for this project 
		as it is beign used for being educational purposes only - however if it were to be used outside of education 
		(i.e. distributing to the public), I understand that there would be copyright implications I would have to bypass in order for this to be possible.</p>
